# Welcome to lilslide

This a web application to create slide using the power of markdown and some custom function that I made

Tasks that's already implemented and needs to be implemented

- [x] Integrate the md editor and the preview (with full screen slide)
- [x] Add styling to the slide using the front matter attributes
- [ ] Create new page [issue-1](https://github.com/judicaelandria/lilslide/issues/1)

I'll add some new things here, but for now this is the feature we should integrate.
**If you have some idea please create a new issue so we can add it to the list too :)**
